  <h2>Coaching With Me</h2>
  <p>My coaching is for high performers who want to stop performing, start listening, and build an abundant life that feels easy to both build and maintain. One that protects our three most precious resources--time, energy, money--to create space for what matters most to you in this given chapter of your life.</p>

<p>But right now, you’re at a turning point, or approaching one.</p>

<p>You’ve been living a life that worked for a while, maybe even looked impressive from the outside. But now, something in you is asking for change.</p>

<p>You might not know what that change is yet, but you know something has to shift because what you’re doing no longer fits. Or because you want your actions to finally line up with your priorities and values.</p>

<p>That’s the work we do together.</p>

<p>I help people reconnect with what actually matters to them and make clear, thoughtful decisions based on that.</p>

<p>You leave with a simpler, truer version of your life, designed to reflect the person you are now, not the version of you who set this all in motion years ago.</p>

  





  <h2>Why Me</h2>
  <p>I’ve left high-paying roles to protect my energy. I’ve worked inside systems and left them when they stopped making sense. I’ve coached Indigenous adults coming out of prison, sat 10-day silent retreats, and taken an unpaid sabbatical to be with my daughter. I’ve redefined what enough means over and over again, through presence, philosophy, and being radically intentional.</p>
  <p>This coaching is built from those experiences. I don’t have answers. But I ask very good questions and help you hear your own answers more clearly than you’ve heard them in a while.</p>

  <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You’ve caught yourself saying “there’s gotta be more to life than <em>this</em>”</li>
    <li>You’re in a period of change (career, parenthood, lifestyle) and want to navigate it with precision and intentionality</li>
    <li>You feel successful in one or two main areas, but undernourished in the other important ones</li>
    <li>You’re tired of feeling tired, not because you’re doing the wrong things, but because you’re doing too many of them</li>
    <li>You want a space to be honest and reflective, not to be pushed along a one-size-fits-all program</li>
    <li>You’re ready to live more deliberately, even if you don’t yet know what that exactly looks like</li>
  </ul>

  

  <h2>Who This Isn’t For</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You’re looking solely for productivity systems, accountability coaching, or business strategy</li>
    <li>You want quick fixes or step-by-step frameworks</li>
    <li>You need therapeutic support (which I fully respect and can refer you to)</li>
  </ul>

  

  <h2>The Structure</h2>
  <p>My clients start with an energetic commitment of 3 months. Transformation, however big or small, requires a commitment to stay the course when results are slow and subtle.</p>

  <p>The investment of the 3-month coaching commitment is <strong>$500/month</strong>. That said, I am flexible with the pricing on a case-by-case basis because I never want money to be the reason you can't become your highest self.</p>

  <p><strong>The 3-month commitment includes:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>2× one-hour sessions per month</li>
  <li>Unlimited async coaching via texting and email between sessions</li>
  <li>A Coaching Hub you have lifetime access to, which includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Pre-session reflection prompts</li>
      <li>Post-session key takeaways, insights, and actionable next steps</li>
      <li>Exercises relevant to session (when applicable)</li>
      <li>Recommended essays, books, and podcasts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
    
  </ul>
  <p><em>At the end of our initial 3 months, we will review your growth and satisfaction with the coaching. We can then decide together if continuing our coaching engagement makes sense and at what cadence.</em></p>

  <h2>The Impact You'll Notice</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You feel lighter by shedding the excess weight of an outdated identity.</li>
    <li>You experience spaciousness, leading to increased creativity, by simplifying your life down to the few most important people, decisions, and actions.</li>
    <li>Your self-confidence increases and is quiet because you know you're leading the right life for you, but you don't feel the need for outside approval or validation.</li>
    <li>You feel richer since your relationships are more full, your work is fueled by internal drive, and you know how to use your money as a tool to further enable what you care about most.</li>
  </ul>

  

  <h2>Testimonials</h2>
  <p>"I was introduced to Aatik during a point in my life where I was facing major crossroads. I knew I had options but they were not clear; guided me during this transition phase. One of the things I really appreciated was the environment he created (with the help of music and meditation) and the unbiased feedback he provided to me. Aatik definitely helped me question myself and understand what my priorities are and what I want my focus to be. There was a lot of extra noise like doubt and anxiety in me—he helped cut through. He provided me with the clarity I needed during that time. Aatik has an extremely calming presence. I really appreciated his insight and wisdom."<br>- <em>Isra K.</em></p>
  <p>"I can't recommend Aatik enough. He has not only helped me become the best version of myself but also guided me to uncover my true values and align them with my career goals. His support and insights have been life-changing, giving me a fresh perspective on both my personal and professional life. In my personal career journey, I struggled with finding the right path that truly maximized success. This over-calculating mindset led me down a path that, while productive, wasn’t fulfilling. Aatik helped me realize a direction that resonates with who I genuinely want to become. Since embracing this newfound clarity, I’ve been living every day authentically for myself, and it’s an incredible feeling."<br>- <em>Alec N.</em></p>
  <p>"Receiving coaching from Aatik has been a remarkable experience. Each week I found myself with an excitement for our sessions and felt compelled to take action afterwards. He has a depth of experience as a meditator, which shows when he occasionally opened our sessions with a guided meditation to create space for things to rise to the surface. Getting clarity on what I need and want was invaluable."<br>- <em>Luke M.</em></p>
