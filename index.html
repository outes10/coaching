  <h2>Coaching With Aatik</h2>
  <p>My coaching practice is for high performers who are seeking a new way to operate at their fullest capacity in all domains of life without sacrificing their ambition.</p>
  <p>I specifically work with clients who are noticing their current approach to work is no longer producing the output they are capable of.</p>
  <p>Clients who are at this powerful juncture are either:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Obsessed with their craft, but feel their creativity or output is capped by their current way of operating; or</li>
    <li>Learning they don‚Äôt love their current trajectory and want to refresh their approach to their work, or pivot to a more aligned path.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you see yourself in any of the above, keep reading.</p>
  <p>Right now, you‚Äôre at a turning point, or approaching one. You‚Äôve possibly been living a life that worked for a while, and looked impressive from the outside. But now, something in you is asking for change.</p>
  <p>It's reasonable to doubt that it‚Äôs possible to undergo such a change without sacrificing your ambition or career.</p>
  <p>I‚Äôm here to tell you that <strong>honouring all parts of your life, if done properly, can <em>fuel</em> your creativity and your craft.</strong></p>
  <p>That‚Äôs the work we do together.</p>
  <p>I help people reconnect with what <em>actually</em> matters to them and make clear, thoughtful decisions based on that.</p>
  <p>You leave with a simpler, truer version of your life, designed to reflect the person you are now, not the version of you who set this all in motion years ago.</p>

  <h2>My coaching is NOT for you if:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You‚Äôre looking solely for productivity systems, accountability coaching, or business strategy</li>
    <li>You want quick fixes or step-by-step frameworks</li>
    <li>You need therapeutic support (which I fully respect and can refer you to)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My coaching is for you if:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You catch yourself asking, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more to life than this, right?‚Äù</li>
    <li>Your previous definition of success is no longer relevant or maybe even working against you</li>
    <li>You‚Äôre in a period of change (career, parenthood, lifestyle) and want to navigate it with precision and intentionality</li>
    <li>You feel successful in one or two main areas, but undernourished in the other important ones</li>
    <li>You‚Äôre tired of feeling tired, not because you‚Äôre doing the wrong things, but because you‚Äôre doing too many of them</li>
    <li>You struggle finding a coach who is equally understanding and intense</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Me</h2>
  <p>I walk the walk. I‚Äôve left high-status careers to focus on one that makes me feel alive. I‚Äôve taken pay cuts to gain unique experiences, taken my craft to the highest level, and then taken an unpaid year off once my first child was born. I‚Äôve honoured each unique chapter in my life, proven by my track record of many intentional pivots for the past decade. My experimental and iterative approach to life is fuelled by a mix of studying philosophy, practicing contemplative traditions, and remaining unapologetically curious and intentional with every single decision that crosses my path.</p>
  <p>My coaching practice is built from these experiences.</p>
  <p>Speaking of coaching: I don't like this word. I use it to communicate the general concept efficiently to you, but a better description would be: having real conversations, meaning where I challenge your opinions and beliefs with genuine care for you and the utmost respect for your capability.</p>
  <p>I don‚Äôt have answers. But I ask very good questions and help you hear your own answers more clearly than you‚Äôve heard them in a while.</p>

  <h2>The Structure</h2>
  <p>My clients start with an energetic commitment of 3 months. Transformation, however big or small, requires a commitment to stay the course when results are slow and subtle. After the initial 3 months, we‚Äôll decide together what cadence moving forward makes sense for your unique set of variables.</p>
  <p>The investment is $500/month. That said, I am open to flexible pricing on a case-by-case basis because I never want money to be an obstacle to your highest self.</p>

  <p>The 3-month commitment includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>2√ó one-hour sessions per month</li>
    <li>Unlimited async coaching via texting and email between sessions</li>
    <li>A Coaching Hub you have lifetime access to, which includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Pre-session reflection prompts</li>
        <li>Post-session key takeaways, insights, and actionable next steps</li>
        <li>Exercises that organically emerge from each session</li>
        <li>Recommended resources (essays, books, and podcasts)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Testimonials</h2>
  <blockquote>
    "I can't recommend Aatik enough. He has not only helped me become the best version of myself but also guided me to uncover my true values and align them with my career goals. His support and insights have been life-changing, giving me a fresh perspective on both my personal and professional life. In my personal career journey, I struggled with finding the right path that truly maximized success. This over-calculated mindset led me down a path that, while productive, wasn‚Äôt fulfilling. Aatik helped me realize a direction that resonates with who I genuinely want to become. Since embracing this newfound clarity, I‚Äôve been living every day authentically for myself, and it‚Äôs an incredible feeling."<em> ‚Äî Alec N. (29M, Startup SWE)</em>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    "I was introduced to Aatik during a point in my life where I was facing major crossroads. I knew I had options but they were not clear; guided me during this transition phase. One of the things I really appreciated was the environment he created (with the help of music and meditation) and the unbiased feedback he provided to me. Aatik definitely helped me question myself and understand what my priorities are and what I want my focus to be. There was a lot of extra noise like doubt and anxiety in me‚Äîhe helped cut through. He provided me with the clarity I needed during that time. Aatik has an extremely calming presence. I really appreciated his insight and wisdom."<em> ‚Äî Isra K. (34F, Program Manager)</em>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    "Receiving coaching from Aatik has been a remarkable experience. Each week I found myself with an excitement for our sessions and felt compelled to take action afterwards. He has a depth of experience as a meditator, which shows when he occasionally opened our sessions with guided meditation to create space for things to rise to the surface. Getting clarity on what I need and want was invaluable."<em> ‚Äî Luke M. (28M, Founder)</em>
